      <p>
        TechCon began in 2015 as a small community meetup for local developers and technology 
        enthusiasts. Over the years, it has grown into an international conference that attracts 
        participants from around the world. Each year, TechCon has expanded its tracks, workshops, 
        and exhibition areas to reflect the latest trends in software development, cloud computing, 
        cybersecurity, and digital innovation.
      </p>

      <p>
        From its early days in a single auditorium to today’s multi-day, multi-stage event, TechCon 
        has always focused on bringing people together to learn, share, and experiment with emerging 
        technologies.
